# Dark+ Blue Theme

![Dark+ Blue Theme](images/screenshot.png "Dark+ Blue Theme")

This is a derivative of the "Tomorrow Night Blue" color theme, except it uses the Visual Studio semantic coloring of Dark+.

I made this color theme because I like the editor color scheme of Tomorrow Night Blue, but I also like the semantic text coloring of Visual Studio. So why not combine them?

The only other change is making C/C++ macros pink. For some reason, Dark+ makes them blue, which I do not like...
